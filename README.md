## Project Setup :pencil:
If you want to clone this project and customize it further, you need to do a couple of tasks first:
1. Download this repository and open it in your text editor
2. In public/electron.js, comment and uncomment the code as shown below
```
//win.loadURL(`file://${path.join(__dirname, "../build/index.html")}`) 
win.loadURL("http://localhost:3000");
```
3. In src/App.js, press Ctrl+F and change HashRouter to BrowserRouter
4. Now open the terminal, write the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
5. Finally, open a new terminal and write the following command:
```
npm run electron
```

You will see the app being launched on your computer.

## Generating EXE / APP / Linux Executable Files :memo:
1. To generate an executable file depending upon your platform, open public/electron.js file and there, comment the following line
```
win.loadURL("http://localhost:3000")
```
2. Then uncomment the following line
```
//win.loadURL(`file://${path.join(__dirname, "../build/index.html")}`) 
```
3. In src/App.js, press Ctrl+F and change BrowserRouter to HashRouter
4. Open terminal and write:
```
npm run build 
npx electron-packager .
```
5. This will build a .exe/.app/linux executable file depending on your operating system. To generate an executable file for some other platform, use the command below:
```
npx electron-packager <sourcedir> <appname> --platform=<platform> --arch=<arch> [optional flags...]
```
